The Best Open Source Software alternatives list, for most popular services and websites!

</div>

## Why?

Privacy nowadays is an aspect forgotten from most people and many companies take advantage of that. For instance, how many times have you clicked on "I accept" when you are asked to enable cookies? Let me guess. Most (if not every) of the times, right?

If you found this project yourself, then I can assume that you're either A FOSS enthusiast or someone who's seeking privacy. If you were suggested this list, then I can also guess that you use Google, YouTube, Google Chrome and Microsoft Windows.

Either way, everyone has the right to freedom and privacy and here a list with tips & tricks, websites, applications, Operating Systems and pretty much everything that you use to access the web.
